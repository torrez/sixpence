# Sixpence

This is a jQuery plugin that accepts a Twitter user name and URL and searches
Twitter for the last tweet by that user mentioning that URL. It then populates 
an element with the tweet body and links to favorite, reply, and retweet that tweet. 

You would use this if you are interested in getting favorites or retweets to your blog posts. 
Sort of like a poor man's Google +1 or Facebook Like button. 

Note: the Twitter Search API results are only available for 6 to 9 days. So if a tweet is not 
found it will hide the original element.
